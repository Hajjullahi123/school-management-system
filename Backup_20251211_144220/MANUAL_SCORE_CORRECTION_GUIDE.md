# How to Correct Student Scores (Manual & Bulk)

## Overview
There are two ways to correct a student's score if a mistake is made:
1.  **Re-uploading the Excel File** (Best for fixing many students at once).
2.  **Manual Online Correction** (Best for quickly fixing 1 or 2 students).

## Option 1: Re-upload (Bulk Correction)
If you made a mistake in the Excel file itself (e.g., gave the wrong score to 10 students):

1.  **Open the Excel/CSV file** on your computer.
2.  **Correct the scores** in the file.
3.  **Save** the file.
4.  Go to **Dashboard** > **Bulk Result Upload**.
5.  Select your Subject/Class assignment.
6.  **Upload the corrected file**.
    *   The system will automatically **update** the existing records.
    *   It will **not** create duplicates.
    *   Look for the message "X Records Updated".
