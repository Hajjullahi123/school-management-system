## 📞 COLD CALL SCRIPT

**Goal:** Get a meeting/demo scheduled

```
Ring... Ring...

THEM: "Hello?"

YOU: "Good morning/afternoon! Am I speaking with [Principal/Director Name]?"

THEM: "Yes, this is [him/her]."

YOU: "Great! My name is [Your Name] from [Company]. I apologize for the 
      cold call - I'll be very brief.

      I'm calling because we specialize in helping schools like [School Name] 
      reduce their administrative workload by up to 60% while saving 
      hundreds of thousands of naira annually.

      We've recently helped [Local School Name] automate their entire 
      result processing - what used to take 2 weeks now takes 3 seconds.

      I know you're busy, so here's my question: If I could show you how 
      to eliminate manual result computation, track fees automatically, 
      and give parents instant access to their children's performance - 
      all while saving you money - would that be worth 20 minutes of your time?"

THEM: [Response]

IF INTERESTED:
"Excellent! I have [Time 1] or [Time 2] available this week. 
 Which works better for you?"

IF "SEND ME INFORMTION":
"Absolutely! I'll email you our brochure right away. 
 May I have your email address?
 
 And while I have you - what's your biggest administrative challenge 
 right now? That way I can send you specific information about solving it."

IF "NOT INTERESTED":
"I completely understand. May I ask - is it that you're happy with your 
 current process, or is it just not a priority right now?"

[Listen and respond accordingly]

"That makes sense. Would it be okay if I sent you a quick 2-minute video 
 showing what I'm talking about? No obligation - just so you know what's 
 out there when you're ready."

IF "CALL BACK LATER":
"Of course! When would be a better time? 
 [Schedule specific day and time]
 
 I'll call you back on [Day] at [Time]. Thanks for your time!"

---

## CLOSING:
"Perfect! I'll see you [Day] at [Time]. 
 I'll send you a calendar invite with a Zoom link.
 Looking forward to showing you how we can help [School Name]!
 Have a great day!"
```

## 📱 WHATSAPP/SMS MESSAGE SCRIPT

**First Message:**
```
Good morning [Name]! 👋

This is [Your Name] from [Company]. 

Quick question: Are you still using manual processes for student 
results and reports at [School Name]?

We've helped 10+ schools automate this completely - saving them 
60% of admin time and ₦500k+ annually.

Would a quick 20-min demo interest you? 
📅 [Calendly Link]

Or reply with your preferred day/time!

Thanks,
[Your Name]
📞 [Phone]
```

**Follow-up (3 days later):**
```
Hi [Name]!

Just following up on my previous message. 

Thought you might find this interesting:
[Link to 2-min demo video]

This is what [Local School] is now using. 
Their Principal said: "Wish we had this 5 years ago!"

Free to chat this week?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

## 🎯 OBJECTION HANDLING SCRIPTS

**"We have our own system"**
```
"That's great that you have something in place! Can I ask - 
does your current system:
- Auto-compute results across multiple assessment types?
- Give parents instant online access?
- Handle online fee payments?
- Generate SMS alerts automatically?

If yes, that's fantastic - you're ahead of most schools!
If no, may I show you what's possible? Takes just 15 minutes."
```

**"We can't afford it"**
```
"I totally understand budget constraints. Can I ask - what are you 
currently spending on:
- Result sheets each term?
- Admin staff overtime?
- Manual record keeping?
- Fixing errors and rework?

Most schools spend ₦100k+ per term on these alone.

Our Basic package at ₦200k actually costs LESS than what you're 
spending - plus it eliminates the headaches.

Wouldyou be open to seeing exactly how the numbers work for your school?"
```

**"We're not ready""We'll do it next year"**
```
"I appreciate your honesty! Can I ask - what needs to happen for 
you to be ready?
- Need to see it in action? [Offer demo]
- Budget approval needed? [Offer payment plan]
- Staff buy-in required? [Offer staff presentation]

Also - we have this early adopter discount ending [Date]. 
Waiting until next year means:
- Missing out on ₦[Discount] savings
- Another year of manual processes
- Another year of the same headaches

What if we did a trial with just one class this term? 
Zero commitment - just to see if it works?"
```
