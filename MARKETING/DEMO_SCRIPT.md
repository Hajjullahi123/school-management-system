**ROI Calculation:**

"Let's talk investment...

You currently spend:
- Admin staff time: [₦X per month]
- Result processing: [₦Y per term]
- Parent complaints handling: [₦Z time]

That's roughly ₦[Total] per year.

Our solution: ₦[Package Price] one-time.
Saves you: ₦[Savings] annually.

It pays for itself in [Months] months.
Then pure profit year after year!"
```

**Handle Objections:**

*"It's expensive..."*
```
"I understand. Let me ask: how much do you spend on result sheets, 
printing, admin overtime, and rework due to errors each term?

Most schools we work with spend ₦100k+ per term on these alone.
That's ₦300k per year.

Our [Basic package] at ₦200k saves you ₦100k in year 1.
Plus countless hours of headaches.

Not expensive - it's an investment that pays for itself."
